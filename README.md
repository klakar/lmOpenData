#Installation Instructions
Download and unzip in your QGIS plugins folder...

Change the folder name from "LmOpenData-master" to just "LmOpenData".

#####IMPORTANT: 
Change the API key in the "LmOpenData.py" file to your own personal key!!! (Row 188)

Register at: https://opendata.lantmateriet.se/#register

Activate the plug-in and add layer from "Web" menu.

####Change log:
Version|Change
-------|------
0.2.2|Changed to new token based API (My own token for now)
0.2.1|Added some links to this repository
0.2|Minor update
0.1|First version (local)

###Problem solving
If you get a "Broken Plug-In" message you probably did not remove the "-master" part from the folder name. (Python sometimes don't like "-" )
